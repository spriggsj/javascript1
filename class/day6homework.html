	<div><h2>Day 4 assignment with loops </h2></div>
	
	<div><p>Take the assignment you did for Day 4 and you will modify it for this assignment. The completed code is available on Github under Day 4/Assignment.
In that assignment you used the interface I provided to add elements to the beginning and end of an array when a button was pushed. I want you to make two changes to that code:
Come up with a way to use a loop to print each array item to the output box one at a time. Since the function to write to the output box will always replace the entire contents, you will need to use a string variable in your loop to concatenate all of the array elements into a single string. Then call domOutputText() on your string.
Remember how I showed 4 different ways to add elements to the beginning of the array? (That code also exists in the Github example.) Well I want you to demonstrate one way that you could use loops to accomplish this. There are many ways to solve this, the point is to prove that you have a good understanding of loops.

<form>
    	<!--imput box 1 type text & placeholder in box that says input 1:-->
    	<input id="inputId1" type="text" placeholder="input 1:" /><br>

		<!--imput box 2 type text & placeholder in box that says input 2:-->
    	<input id="inputId2" type="text" placeholder="input 2:" />

    	<!--button with id of goBtnId. Button says go. onclick calls function "insert"-->
    	<input type="button" id="goBtnId" value="go" onclick="insert()" />
  </form>

  <p>Text output:</p>

  
  <!--Text box with 5 rows & id of textOutputId-->
  <textarea rows="5" id="textOutputId"></textarea>
