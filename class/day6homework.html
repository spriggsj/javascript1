	<div><h2>Day 4 assignment with loops </h2></div>
	
	<div><p>Take the assignment you did for Day 4 and you will modify it for this assignment. The completed code is available on Github under Day 4/Assignment.
In that assignment you used the interface I provided to add elements to the beginning and end of an array when a button was pushed. I want you to make two changes to that code:
Come up with a way to use a loop to print each array item to the output box one at a time. Since the function to write to the output box will always replace the entire contents, you will need to use a string variable in your loop to concatenate all of the array elements into a single string. Then call domOutputText() on your string.
Remember how I showed 4 different ways to add elements to the beginning of the array? (That code also exists in the Github example.) Well I want you to demonstrate one way that you could use loops to accomplish this. There are many ways to solve this, the point is to prove that you have a good understanding of loops.
